This file is to take the notes of the things I learnt during this project:

-using cdn font awesome to link "font awesome"
- cdn ---> content delivery network

Steps:
1. link cnd font awesome
2. in CSS set margin to 0, font family , border to border box.
3. Navbar
    * Header
    * div with class navbar and check height in the actual website, even set the background color, and color.
    * add nav-logo using another div and inside it one more div for actual logo
    ** div is only visible when it has a specific height.
    ** if want to add things in a single line in navbar then set display to flex.
    ** it is good to add font size in rem to make the website responsive.
    ** border will be removed if we set it to none.

    # to spread the elements evenly use justify-content: space evenly
    * to change position vertically [align-items]
    * to change position horizantally [jutify-content]
